        Git is a program that creates a repository for a project a developer is working on. In this repository, there is version control which means that a developer can save or commit snap shots of his or her code whenever he or she wants. So, if something goes wrong, the developer can go back to an earlier version and start working from there. Github is a service online that allows you to store your codes online for you and people you allow to see and edit. It also allows you to use Git commands.
